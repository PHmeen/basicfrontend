            <h2>FairyTail 100 Years Quest</h2>
            <p>
                One year following the demise of Zeref and Acnologia, Natsu Dragneel and his team from the Fairy Tail
                wizard guild disembark to the continent of Guiltina in northern Earthland for the 100 Years Quest, a
                mission that has been unaccomplished for over a century. Their client, the immortal Dragon Slayer
                Elefseria, reveals that the quest's purpose is to seal renegade dragons called the Five Dragon
                Gods—Selene, Ignia, Mercphobia, Aldoron, and Viernes—each of whom rivals Acnologia in strength and
                threatens to cause worldwide destruction. Natsu subdues Mercphobia with aid from Ignia, Igneel's
                malicious biological son, who challenges Natsu to strengthen himself for a one-on-one battle.

            <h2>Blue Lock</h2>
            <p>Japan's desire for World Cup glory leads the Japanese Football Association to launch a new rigorous
                training program to find the national team's next striker. Three hundred high school players are pitted
                against each other
                for the position, but only one will come out on top. Who among them will be the striker to usher in a
                new era of Japanese soccer?
